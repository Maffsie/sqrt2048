# 2048, for the PicoSystem (and 32Blit later)

This will eventually be a full 2048 clone for the 32Blit, PicoSystem, and any other 32blit-compatible hardware.

Currently, it is a miserable pile of boilerplate.

## Requirements

* `brew install sdl2{,_{gfx,image,mixer,net,ttf}}`
* `pip3 install 32blit`
* `git clone https://github.com/32blit/32blit-sdk`
* `git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-extras`
* `git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk`
I'm using tilt controls.
